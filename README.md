# Final Project Template Repo
# AerE 361 Final Project

## Final Project Requirement
All groups should use this template repo to setup the repo they will use for their Final Project. This repo includes some basic information and the folder structure we are expecting.


# Folders
The following folders are required for all projects.

- firmware
- reports
- presentations

You may also wish to include some additional folders as well. These are not required, but may be helpful as you research your project. We suggest the following:

- Datasheets
- Whitepapers

The following folders may be needed if you are doing a project that will analyze data.

- analysis
  - source
  - results
  - data

# Readme File
This Readme.MD file should eventually replace with one that is relevant to your project. Your readme file must include the following

- The name of your group
- The names of the students involved
- What your project does
- A picture of your project (include before the semester ends)

Optionally, you can include other information as well. This might be more information about your project, relevant links or other information you want those that might visit your repo to know.
