# Final Project Template Repo
# AerE 361 Final Project
# MAY BE REQUIRED FOLDER

## Analysis Folder
If your group is doing a project that will record data and do some analysis on that data, then this folder is required. If not, it is optional. This folder should have the following sub-folders

- source
- results
- data

You will need to create these on your own. Note that GitHub does not allow blank folders, so you will need to put something in there for it to be pushed to GitHub.
